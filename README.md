##Versa News


#About
Versa News allows users to browse through their favorite Vice articles and videos with style. Versa allows users to browse any category of their choice, as well as view and share articles with their friends on Facebook and Twitter. Versa also allows users to search by tags to fast-track their news-reading experience. Versa's dynamic theme brings to life the dynamic culture that made Vice so popular in the first place, and hopes to live up to all expectations set before it.

#Bugs
. Minor layout issues when using different phones. 
. Memory issues present (sometimes) when rapidly scrolling. 
. Twitter's share feature is missing direct links because of lack of 'whitelisting' from Twitter. (May be implemented in the future)
